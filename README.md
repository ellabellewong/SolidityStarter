# SolidityStarter
This is a basic Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity. It demonstrates the use of ownership, error handling, and various Solidity features such as require, assert, and revert.

**Features**
- Ownership: Only the contract owner can perform certain operations, including setting a new value and transferring ownership.
- Value Management: The owner can set a value, which must be positive. The contract also includes a function to assert that the value remains below a specified threshold.
- Revert Example: Demonstrates the use of the revert function to reject certain values.
- Ownership Transfer: The contract allows the owner to transfer ownership to a new address.

**Contract Functions**
`constructor`
Description: Sets the initial owner of the contract to the address that deploys the contract.
`onlyOwner` modifier
Description: A modifier that restricts access to functions only to the contract owner.
`setValue(uint256 _value)`
Description: Sets a new value to the contract, but only if the value is positive. Can only be called by the contract owner.
Parameters:
`_value`: The new value to be set.
Error Handling: Requires _value > 0.
`checkInvariant()`
Description: A function to check the contract invariant by asserting that the current value is less than 1 million. If the assertion fails, the transaction is reverted.
`revertExample(uint256 _value)`
Description: Demonstrates the use of revert. If the input value is equal to 42, the transaction is reverted with an error message.
Parameters:
_value: The input value to be checked.
`transferOwnership(address newOwner)`
Description: Allows the current owner to transfer ownership to a new address.
Parameters:
`newOwner`: The address to which ownership is being transferred.
Error Handling: Requires newOwner not to be the zero address.

**Error Handling**
The contract uses the following mechanisms to handle errors:
- require: Used to ensure conditions are met before performing an action. If the condition is not met, the transaction reverts.
- assert: Used for internal consistency checks. If the condition is violated, the transaction is reverted and the state is unchanged.
- revert: Used to revert a transaction with a custom error message. In this contract, it is used to prevent the value 42 from being passed to the function.
